# RPG Battle System
 A concept for a timing-based battle system.
 
 An action token moves along a series of panels called the action gauge. Press the mouse button to stop the token. Where the token lands on the gauge is the player's action. Characters can have multiple attacks per turn.
 
 Besides the combat system, I've added a simple dungeon crawling portion, where the objective is to rescue fellow heroes and get as far as possible before you die. You can encounter random events that will help or hinder your progress.
