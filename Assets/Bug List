1. Duplicate Enemy names are modified but then go back to normal. Need to find out how to keep the modified names. *FIXED*
2. Some dungeons can't be completed because there not all nodes have connecting paths. Need to find a way to guarantee all dungeons are solvable. *FIXED*
3. Prevent player from moving diagonally to an adjacent node. *FIXED*
4. FOr some reason, the player sprite in party UI doesn't appear for the controlled hero. *Fixed*
5. The encounters are getting mixed up. Player contacts 1 map enemy but then another map enemy is affected when combat ends. *FIXED*
6. Hero aura doesn't animate correctly for the hero who ended the previous battle.
7. Fix issue with treasure chests not generating correctly after the first dungeon. *FIXED*
8. Major enemy node ID is -1 for some reason. Need to figure out the problem. Additional issue: if I set dungeon level to 5 as a test, I immediately go into combat with major enemy.
